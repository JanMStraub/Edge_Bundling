## 22.10.22
    * changes list initialization for nodeList, edgeList and terminalNodeList @ environment.py

## 24.10.22
    * Implemented check for early inner iteration stop
    * calculateFlux, updateConductivities and edge cutting in one loop

## 25.10.22
    * Set outer iteration bounds by multiplying the longer axis with the number of terminal nodes

## 27.10.22
    * Reduced number of loops in createGridEdges

## 30.10.22
    * Changed grid creation to use "start-end" id for edges

## 15.11.22
    * Implemented node removal inside the calculatePressure function

## 26.11.22
    * Changed order of edge id

## 27.11.22
