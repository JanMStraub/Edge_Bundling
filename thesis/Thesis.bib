	abstract = {Edge bundling is a promising graph visualization approach to simplifying the visual result of a graph drawing. Plenty of edge bundling methods have been developed to generate diverse graph layouts. However, it is difficult to defend an edge bundling method with its resulting layout against other edge bundling methods as a clear theoretic evaluation framework is absent in the literature. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to evaluate the visual results of edge bundling techniques. We first illustrate the advantage of edge bundling visualizations for large graphs, and pinpoint the ambiguity resulting from drawing results. Second, we define and quantify the amount of information delivered by edge bundling visualization from the underlying network using information theory. Third, we propose a new algorithm to evaluate the resulting layouts of edge bundling using the amount of the mutual information between a raw network dataset and its edge bundling visualization. Comparison examples based on the proposed framework between different edge bundling techniques are presented.},

Apart from clustering, our entire pipeline is image-based with an efficient implementation in graphics hardware. Besides speed and implementation simplicity, our method allows explicit control of the emphasis on structure of the bundled layout, i.e. the creation of strongly branching (organic-like) or smooth bundles.

	abstract = {An increasing number of tasks require people to explore, navigate and search extremely complex data sets visualized as graphs. Examples include electrical and telecommunication networks, Web structures, and airline routes. The problem is that graphs of these real world data sets have many interconnected nodes, ultimately leading to edge congestion: the density of edges is so great that they obscure nodes, individual edges, and even the visual information beneath the graph. To address this problem we developed an interactive technique called {EdgeLens}. An {EdgeLens} interactively curves graph edges away for a person's focus attention without changing the node positions. This opens up sufficient space to disambiguate node and edge relationships and to see underlying information while still preserving node layout. Initially two methods of creating this interaction were developed and compared in a user study. The results of this study were used in the selection of a basic approach and the subsequent development of the {EdgeLens}. We then improved the {EdgeLens} through use of transparency and colour and by allowing multiple lenses to appear on the graph.},

However, existing edge-bundled {PCP} do not scale well for visual analysis of multidimensional big data and often overplot the bundles in the area near the axes. In this study, we propose a scalable lightweight bundling method to support visual analysis of multidimensional big data in {PCP}. It helps the users discover trends and detect outliers in the data by bundling the edges between each two adjacent axes independently. We integrate human judgments into the two-dimensional data binning by novel interactions to accelerate the clustering process of the data. We use the frequency-based representation to render the clusters as histogram-like bundles to reveal the distribution of the data and eliminate the overplotting of the bundles. Based on our method, we build a lightweight web-based visual analytics system for exploring multidimensional big data in {PCP}. The scalability analysis of our method shows that its clustering time increases linearly with the size of the data. Its rendering time is independent of the size of the data. We conduct two case studies and a user study to compare our method with classic {PCP} and two state-of-the-art edge-bundled {PCP}.},

While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.},

Our overview analyses existing techniques along four dimensions: (i) the representation of geographical information, (ii) the representation of network information, (iii) the visual integration of both and (iv) the use of interaction. These four dimensions allow us to discuss techniques with respect to the trade-offs they make between showing information across all these dimensions and how they solve the problem of showing as much information as necessary while maintaining readability of the visualization. https://geonetworks.github.io.},

	abstract = {Bundling techniques provide a visual simplification of a graph drawing or trail set, by spatially grouping similar graph edges or trails.

In this state of the art report, we aim to improve the understanding of graph and trail bundling via the following main contributions. First, we propose a data-based taxonomy that organizes bundling methods on the type of data they work on (graphs vs trails, which we refer to as paths). Based on a formal definition of path bundling, we propose a generic framework that describes the typical steps of all bundling algorithms in terms of high-level operations and show how existing method classes implement these steps. Next, we propose a description of tasks that bundling aims to address. Finally, we provide a wide set of example applications of bundling techniques and relate these to the above-mentioned taxonomies. Through these contributions, we aim to help both researchers and users to understand the bundling landscape as well as its technicalities.},

All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of Edge-Path bundling over other techniques.},

Drawings of such graphs generally suffer from visual clutter induced by the large amount of edges and their crossings.

Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to help solve this issue, which rely on high quality edge rerouting. In this paper, we introduce an intuitive edge bundling technique which efficiently reduces edge clutter in graphs drawings. Our method is based on the use of a grid built using the original graph to compute the edge rerouting. In comparison with previously proposed edge bundling methods, our technique improves both the level of clutter reduction and the computation performance.

Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, {CDs} bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While {CDs} have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing {CDs} from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in {CDs}, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including {CD}, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small {CDs} without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, {CDs} are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity.},

Although different approaches are available to create visual representations, most of them suffer from clutter when faced with many nodes and/or edges. Among the techniques that address this problem, edge bundling has attained relative success in improving node-link layouts by bending and aggregating edges. Despite their success, most approaches perform the bundling based only on visual space information. There is no explicit connection between the produced bundled visual representation and the underlying data (edges or vertices attributes). In this paper, we present a novel edge bundling technique, called Similarity-Driven Edge Bundling ({SDEB}), to address this issue. Our method creates a similarity hierarchy based on a multilevel partition of the data, grouping edges considering the similarity between nodes to guide the bundling. The novel features introduced by {SDEB} are explored in different application scenarios, from dynamic graph visualization to multilevel exploration. Our results attest that {SDEB} produces layouts that consistently follow the similarity relationships found in the graph data, resulting in semantically richer presentations that are less cluttered than the state-of-the-art.},

However, node-link diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow. Finally, we present a rendering technique that can be used to emphasize the bundling.},

We present a new technique that improves on both above points, in terms of increasing both the scalability and computational speed of bundling, while keeping the quality of the results on par with state-of-the-art techniques. For this, we shift the bundling process from the image space to the spectral (frequency) space, thereby increasing computational speed. We address scalability by proposing a data streaming process that allows bundling of extremely large datasets with limited {GPU} memory.

Existing numerical methods face challenges due to the non-convexity of the problem. Using a representation of curves and surfaces via differential forms on the ambient space, we reformulate this problem as a convex optimization. This change of variables overcomes many difficulties in previous numerical attempts and allows us to find the global minimum across all possible surface topologies. The new algorithm is based on differential forms on the ambient space and does not require handling meshes. We adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier ({ADMM}) to find global minimal surfaces. The resulting algorithm is simple and efficient: it boils down to an alternation between a Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) and a pointwise shrinkage operation. We also show other applications of our solver in geometry processing such as surface reconstruction.},

The results provide insights into probability distributions for the entire network-not only for individual nodes and edges. We validate our approach using three data sets that represent a wide range of network types: synthetic data, protein-protein interactions from the {STRING} database, and travel times extracted from Google Maps.

Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets. We demonstrate our approach with extensive experiments.},

Our approach is to use a technique we call confluent drawing for visualizing non-planar diagrams in a planar way. This approach allows us to draw, in a crossing-free manner, graphs--such as software interaction diagrams--that would normally have many crossings. The main idea of this approach is quite simple: we allow groups of edges to be merged together and drawn as "tracks" (similar to train tracks). Producing such confluent diagrams automatically from a graph with many crossings is quite challenging, however, so we offer two heuristic algorithms to test if a non-planar graph can be drawn efficiently in a confluent way. In addition, we identify several large classes of graphs that can be completely categorized as being either confluently drawable or confluently non-drawable.},

As a result, this hinders the user ability to create efficient aggregated visualizations. To address these issues, we investigated a novel way of handling visual aggregation with a task-driven and user-centered approach. Given a graph, our approach produces a decluttered view as follows: first, the user investigates different edge bundling results and specifies areas, where certain edge bundling techniques would provide user-desired results. Second, our system then computes a smooth and structural preserving transition between these specified areas. Lastly, the user can further fine-tune the global visualization with a direct manipulation technique to remove the local ambiguity and to apply different visual deformations. In this paper, we provide details for our design rationale and implementation. Also, we show how our algorithm gives more suitable results compared to current edge bundling techniques, and in the end, we provide concrete instances of usages, where the algorithm combines various edge bundling results to support diverse data exploration and visualizations.},

Next, we express all curves in a given cluster in terms of a centroid curve and a complementary term, via a set of so-called principal component functions. Based on the above, we propose a two-fold contribution: First, we use cluster centroids to design a new bundling method for 2D and 3D curve-sets. Secondly, we deform the cluster centroids and generate new curves along them, which enables us to modify the underlying data in a statistically-controlled way via its simplified (bundled) view. We demonstrate our method by applications on real-world 2D and 3D datasets for graph bundling, trajectory analysis, and vector field and tensor field visualization.},

	abstract = {Visualization of graphs containing many nodes and edges efficiently is quite challenging since representations generally suffer from visual clutter induced by the large amount of edge crossings and node-edge overlaps. That problem becomes even more important when nodes po- sitions are fixed, such as in geography were nodes posi- tions are set according to geographical coordinates. Edge bundling techniques can help to solve this issue by visu- ally merging edges along common routes but it can also help to reveal high-level edge patterns in the network and therefore to understand its overall organization. In this pa- per, we present a generalization of [18] to reduce the clut- ter in a 3D representation by routing edges into bundles as well as a {GPU}-based rendering method to emphasize bundles densities while preserving edge color. To visualize geographical networks in the context of the globe, we also provide a new technique allowing to bundle edges around and not across it.},

To address this issue, we propose an edge-bundling algorithm based on the expectation model, and the edge-bundling rules can be modularized to support the addition of calculation rules. The stability of the proposed method is improved. Our experimental results with 2D and 3D scenarios demonstrate that our algorithm produces superior results that unclutter complex graphs.},

Low-stretch quasi-trees also have provable sparseness guarantees, providing algorithmic support for aggressive de-cluttering of hairball graphs. {LSQT} does not rely on previously computed vertex positions and computes bundles based on topological structure before any geometric layout occurs. Edge bundles are computed efficiently and stored in an explicit data structure that supports sophisticated visual encoding and interaction techniques, including dynamic layout adjustment and interactive bundle querying. Our unoptimized implementation handles graphs of over 100,000 edges in eight seconds, providing substantially higher performance than previous approaches.},

We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.},

Acellular slime mould P. polycephalum is originally famous as a computing biological substrate due to its alleged ability to approximate shortest path from its inoculation site to a source of nutrients. Several algorithms were designed based on properties of the slime mould. Many of the Physarum-inspired algorithms suffer from a low converge speed. To accelerate the search of a solution and reduce a number of iterations we combined an original model of Physarum-inspired path solver with a new a parameter, called energy. We undertook a series of computational experiments on approximating shortest paths in networks with different topologies, and number of nodes varying from 15 to 2000. We found that the improved Physarum algorithm matches well with existing Physarum-inspired approaches yet outperforms them in number of iterations executed and a total running time. We also compare our algorithm with other existing algorithms, including the ant colony optimization algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm.},

After that, we analyze the network optimization problems and applications that have been challenged by {PAs} based on these models. Ultimately, we discuss the existing researches on {PAs} and identify two fundamental questions: 1) What are the characteristics of Physarum networks? 2) Why can Physarum solve some network optimization problems?

	abstract = {Recently it has been shown that Physarum-inspired algorithms can solve some network optimization problems. However, it is not yet shown that Physarum-inspired algorithm can solve Node Weighted Steiner Tree Problem ({NWSTP}). Two new Physarum-inspired algorithms are proposed in this paper to solve {NWSTP} for the first time. Since all the existing {NWSTP} benchmark instances have an empty terminal set, new benchmark instances with non-empty terminal sets are generated to cover the shortage of existing benchmark instances. Both proposed algorithms are compared with Genetic Algorithm ({GA}) and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization ({DPSO}) in these benchmark instances. Furthermore, an adapted Dijkstra's algorithm is proposed to provide the optimal solutions for part of these benchmark instances where there are two terminals and the node weights are negative. Simulation results show that our first proposed algorithm can find the optimal solutions for {NWSTP} with two terminals in graphs with negative node weights, and our second proposed algorithm can find close approximate solutions for {NWSTP} with multiple terminals in any node weighted graph. Both proposed algorithms provide faster and better {NWSTP} solutions than {GA} and {DPSO}.},

	abstract = {Most studies of pattern formation place particular emphasis on its role in the development of complex multicellular body plans. In simpler organisms, however, pattern formation is intrinsic to growth and behavior. Inspired by one such organism, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we present examples of complex emergent pattern formation and evolution formed by a population of simple particle-like agents. Using simple local behaviors based on Chemotaxis, the mobile agent population spontaneously forms complex and dynamic transport networks. By adjusting simple model parameters, maps of characteristic patterning are obtained. Certain areas of the parameter mapping yield particularly complex long term behaviors, including the circular contraction of network lacunae and bifurcation of network paths to maintain network connectivity. We demonstrate the formation of irregular spots and labyrinthine and reticulated patterns by chemoattraction. Other Turing-like patterning schemes were obtained by using chemorepulsion behaviors, including the self-organization of regular periodic arrays of spots, and striped patterns. We show that complex pattern types can be produced without resorting to the hierarchical coupling of reaction-diffusion mechanisms. We also present network behaviors arising from simple pre-patterning cues, giving simple examples of how the emergent pattern formation processes evolve into networks with functional and quasi-physical properties including tensionlike effects, network minimization behavior, and repair to network damage. The results are interpreted in relation to classical theories of biological pattern formation in natural systems, and we suggest mechanisms by which emergent pattern formation processes may be used as a method for spatially represented unconventional computation. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

	abstract = {Relay node placement, which aims to connect pre-deployed sensor nodes to base stations, is essential in minimizing the costs of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we formulate the new Node-Weighted Partial Terminal Steiner Tree Problem ({NWPTSTP}) for minimum-cost relay node placement in two-tiered wireless sensor networks. The objective is to minimize the sum of heterogeneous production and placement costs of relay nodes and the sum of outage probabilities of transmission routes in a routing tree simultaneously. This extends the previous work that considers the costs of relay nodes to be homogeneous. After formulating {NWPTSTP} for this purpose, we prove that it can be transformed to the existing node-weighted Steiner tree problem. Subsequently, we conduct some theoretical analyses on the emerging Physarum-inspired algorithms to reveal their potential of computing Steiner trees. Based on these analyses, we propose a new Physarum-inspired algorithm for solving {NWPTSTP}. We conduct computational trials to show that: 1) in comparison to a state-of-the-art approximation algorithm for solving the node-weighted Steiner tree problem, our Physarum-inspired algorithm can produce better solutions in a smaller amount of time; and 2) in comparison to two state-of-the-art relay node placement algorithms, our Physarum-inspired algorithm can design wireless sensor networks with 25\% lower relay cost and similar quality of service (specifically, 5\% shorter network lifetime, 2\% longer delay, and 0\% loss of goodput). This indicates the usefulness of our Physarum-inspired algorithm for minimum-cost relay node placement in budget-limited scenarios.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4969},
	abstract = {The Travelling Salesman Problem ({TSP}) is a well known and challenging combinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean {TSP} using a virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a set of data points projected into the lattice, representing {TSP} city locations, and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is elicited corresponding to a {TSP} tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour length of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an exact {TSP} solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and discuss the relationship between the blob {TSP} and proximity graphs which group points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the {TSP} and suggest possibilities for further improvement.},

	doi = {10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2008.4475457},
	abstract = {In visualizing graphs as node-link diagrams, it is commonly accepted and employed as a general rule that the number of link crossings should be minimized whenever possible. However, little attention has been paid to how to handle the remaining crossings in the visualization. The study presented in this paper examines the effects of crossing angles on performance of path tracing tasks. It was found that the effect varied with the size of crossing angles. In particular, task response time decreased as the crossing angle increased. However, the rate of the decrease tended to level off when the angle was close to 90 degrees. One of the implications of this study in graph visualization is that just minimizing the crossing number is not sufficient to reduce the negative impact to the minimum. The angles of remaining crossings should be maximized as well.},

	abstract = {Traditional fisheye views for exploring large graphs introduce substantial distortions that often lead to a decreased readability of paths and other interesting structures. To overcome these problems, we propose a framework for structure-aware fisheye views. Using edge orientations as constraints for graph layout optimization allows us not only to reduce spatial and temporal distortions during fisheye zooms, but also to improve the readability of the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework enables us to optimize fisheye lenses towards specific tasks and design a family of new lenses: polyfocal, cluster, and path lenses. A {GPU} implementation lets us process large graphs with up to 15,000 nodes at interactive rates. A comprehensive evaluation, a user study, and two case studies demonstrate that our structure-aware fisheye views improve layout readability and user performance.},
