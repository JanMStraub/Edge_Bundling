# 2022-06-20: Filip, Jan, Maksim

* start time: 14:30
* end time: 14:55
* next meeting: 2022-07-04, 14:30

## Agenda

* Present my Polycephalum idea to Filip

## Agenda for next meeting

* Present Polycephalum code

## Topics discussed

* Idea to reduce ambiguity: Draw edges between Steiner tree points as paralells -> could be done hierachical and would reduce overlaps
* I need to find a convergence value
* The algorithm has to be modified in a way that it does not connect nodes that are not connected in the real graph. It also has to stay in the boundaries of the graph
* Must be topologically conservative: it must not connect what was disconnected and disconnect nothing that was connected
* What are the advantages of Steiner trees for a graph and for the readability of a bundle?

## Progress since last meeting

* Built demo
* Found some motivational aspects for using Polycephalum as bundling algorithm 

## TODO for next meeting

* Explain the Polycephalum algorithm 
* Work on motivation
* Come up with ideas on how to change the original algorithm for our needs
