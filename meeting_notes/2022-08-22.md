# 2022-08-22: Jan, Maksim

* start time: 14:30
* end time: 15:00
* next meeting: 2022-08-29, 14:30

## Agenda

* Talk about my implementation

## Agenda for next meeting

* Bring Filip up to date with my progress
* Show different test cases

## Topics discussed

* I should test my implementation with the grid 
* Test implementation with different graph inputs
* Steiner points could be implemented as the center of each triangle, because every Steiner point has three connections that are 120Â° appart

## Progress since last meeting

* Implemented the algorithm

## TODO for next meeting

* Five different test cases (use graph with 100 nodes) and check if they are the minimal spanning tree
* Implement grid approach for Steiner points
* Steiner point implementation
