## Agenda

* Status update and discuss the next steps.

## Agenda for next meeting

* Look at data in Paraview and the calculated streamlines.

## Topics discussed

* In Paraview it is possible to save the state with all data and plugins loaded as pvsm file. 
* Paraview has a plugin called "stream tracer" that I could use as a baseline for my plugin.
* The second output of my plugin should be polydata.
* Currently the input is a vtk image (vector field) and output is a vtk image. But for debugging purposes it should also output polydata.

## Progress since last meeting

* Got Paraview to work and wrote plugin f√ºr scalar fields.

## TODO for next meeting

* Download weather data and calculate streamlines with the stream tracer plugin.
* Convert downloaded data to a vtk file format as a a uniform grid (rechtwinkliges structured grid).
* If I have access to the IWR wiki: Write a post on how to get a state file from paraview.
