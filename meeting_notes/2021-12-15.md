* start time: 10:15
* end time: 10:40
* next meeting: 2022-01-12, 10:00

## Agenda

* Look at data in Paraview and the calculated streamlines.

## Agenda for next meeting

* Loot at calculated pathlines and discuss plugin code.

## Topics discussed

* I might need a bigger dataset that includes part of the Atlantic and Sub-Saharan Africa up to the european part of Russia.
* My plugin should calculate all by itself and should not depend on data from other filters.
* A short streamline segment should look just like a pathline segment.
* The plugin should generate a grid and for every node it should calculate the positiv and negative streamlines.

## Progress since last meeting

* Downloaded data and calculated pathlines and velocity.

## TODO for next meeting

* Write streamline plugin code.
* Convert downloaded data to a vtk file format as a a uniform grid (rechtwinkliges structured grid).
* Calculate streamlines in Paraview as a comparison for my own calculations.

* If I have access to the IWR wiki: Write a post on how to get a state file from paraview.
