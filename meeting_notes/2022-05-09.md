# 2022-05-09: Filip, Jan, Maksim

* start time: 14:30
* end time: 15:00
* next meeting: 2022-05-18, 16:30

## Agenda

* Talk about my idea

## Agenda for next meeting

* Present and discuss new ideas

## Topics discussed

* Train/Metro map idea is not original enough and I have to look more into edge collaps 
    (Clique (graph theory))
* Could look into bundling induced clustering approaches?
* Maybe an physic based approach like:
    * The graph is a street-grid and sharp turns are not optimal for driving, therefor 
        a big angle for curves is necessary
    * Maybe use minimal surfaces (like soap film) in 3D to generate a graph layout 
        (For this, one has to arrange the points in a way that the resulting minimal 
        surfaces have the graph topology that one was looking for.) 
    * We could vibrate a graph and it should not break. This leads to physically stable 
        graphs and they maybe easy to read.
    * Heat conduction problems (A good graph has good head conduction -> each connection 
        (edge) looses heat)
    * Gravitational bundling?
    * Magnetic flux?

## Progress since last meeting

* Looked into loss of information reduction, dimentionality reduction
* Worked with graph data 
* Searched for graph data examples
* Found paper that dealt with my idea

## TODO for next meeting

* More research
* Have interessting idea for bundling
