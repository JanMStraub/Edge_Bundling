# 2022-05-18: Filip, Jan, Maksim

* start time: 14:30
* end time: 15:00
* next meeting: 2022-05-23, 15:30

## Agenda

* Talk about my idea

## Agenda for next meeting

* Present and discuss new ideas

## Topics discussed

* My idea with the vibrating edges might fundamentally be the same as force-directed 
    * But I could look into probability distribution and I could also look into 
        uncertain graphs
    * Another approach would be to give each edge an electric charge
        and the vibration would lead to a syncronized vibration of adjacent edges 
        -> harmonize
* Maybe use minimal surfaces (like soap film) in 3D to generate a graph layout 
        (For this, one has to arrange the points in a way that the resulting minimal 
        surfaces have the graph topology that one was looking for.) 
    * Could use this idea to look into time dependent graphs 
    * Same concept: water dropplets
* "people" walking on the graph with a certain uncertainty and over time the 
    paths would emerge
* Other ideas could be steppe fire algorithm/ flow graphs/ isotropic smoothing (Joachim Weickert)

## Progress since last meeting

* Had the idea to vibrate edges and if they collide with another edge they get tangled

## TODO for next meeting

* More research
* Have interessting idea for bundling
