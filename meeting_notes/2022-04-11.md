# 2022-04-11: Filip, Jan, Maksim

* start time: 14:30
* end time: 14:50
* next meeting: 2022-04-19, 14:30

## Agenda

* Talk about ideas for the new topic.

## Agenda for next meeting

* Find suitable topic.

## Topics discussed

* Optimize layout of nodes for best possible bundling (Interesting future work would be to design layout algorithms that maximise the Edge-Path bundling as part of the layout process.)
* Edge bundling might not be quantifiable enought
* Could use morphological operators (https://www.kuppelwieser.net/index.php/technik/15-bildverarbeitung/45-morphologie)/ iterative thinning and then think about the properties that this would have
* What is the best continues graphical representation for a multiscale pyramid (?)
* Hypothesis: Edge bundling is not sufficiently quantitative -> many approaches introduce unnecessary information into the graph.
* Spacetime edge bundling where the user could check the bundle at any time (might allready exist)
* "car" that drives along a path and the bundle would unclutter itself along the way (EdgeLens)
* Look at different metrics apart from the geometry of graphs (i.e. curvature)
* Bundle multigraphs/hypergraphs 
* Detection of loops. (Edge-Path bundles can be more convoluted as they must follow shortest paths in a graph. Detection of these loops would solve this issue but remains future work.)
* Optimize for multiple metrics such as ink reduction 

## Progress since last meeting

* Had some ideas.

## TODO for next meeting

* Search for papers on the discussed ideas and find something that suits me.
